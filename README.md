# Inventory-Analysis
Conducted a detailed inventory analysis to identify sales trends, optimize stock levels, and enhance cost efficiency.

Sales Pattern Identification: Discovered a cyclical nature in weekly sales, with a peak around January 25th, likely due to events or seasonal demand. This insight could guide strategic promotion planning.

Product Demand Analysis: Applied ABC analysis to categorize products based on demand levels. Focused on the "A" category for inventory priority due to its substantial contribution (1.5 million in sales), while recommending improvements for low-performing "C" group items.

Inventory Optimization:

Economic Order Quantity (EOQ): Calculated optimal order quantities for high-demand items, achieving a balance between holding costs and stock availability.
Reorder Point (ROP): Determined ROPs tailored to product demand and lead times to avoid stockouts, particularly for high-velocity "A" products.
Lead Time Analysis: Found an average lead time of over a week, advising advanced ordering to sustain inventory levels without overstocking.
Cost Reduction: Recommended strategic adjustments to lower the total inventory value by approximately $65 million through reorder point optimization, reducing carrying costs by 20-25%.
